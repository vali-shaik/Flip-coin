# Java---Software-Development-2
Java program to implement a data structure from basic objects

Problem
===========
Write a class that accepts data values and then lets you search the list to
see if a value is in the list. The key part of the class is in the data structure that it uses to store
the data.
The data structure will have a random behavior to it. For testing purposes, the constructor for
the class will accept an object of type “coin” to use for all the random parts. You will be
supplied with different implementations for the “coin” object: one implementation will use
randomness and the other will let you specify the coin flips yourself so that you can have
deterministic debugging.
